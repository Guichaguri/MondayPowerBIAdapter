# [Monday.com to Power BI Adapter](https://monday-powerbi.herokuapp.com/)

This is an adapter that retrieves data from the Monday API v2 and converts to a Power BI friendly format while maintaining the API key safety.

* Converts the board items to a CSV encoded with Windows-1252
* Optionally formats a few column types to be easier to work with in Power BI
* Optionally includes subitems
* Optionally generates tokens that give access only to a specific board, so you don't have to expose your API Key in a Power BI report (Safe mode)

## Running

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                            | Default                      |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `PORT`             | The HTTP server port number            | `3000`                       |
| `DATABASE_URL`     | The PostgreSQL database connection URL | -                            |
| `MONDAY_BASE_URL`  | The Monday API base URL                | `https://api.monday.com/v2`  |

The database is optional, and if available, allows you to generate tokens that give access only to a specific board.

## Security

I won't look into your data, but you don't have to trust me, feel free to self-host the adapter.
